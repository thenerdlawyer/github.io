# The Nerd Lawyer Blog

From time to time I share my noodlings about law and the practice thereof, technology, entertainment, digital media, and how to spend more time than you could possibly save automating and enhancing your workflow with OmniFocus, DevonThink, MailMate, Hammerspoon, Karabiner, TextExpander, Hazel, Launchbar, Keyboard Maestro, Shortcat, and a rudimentary grasp of various programming languages.

The theme is heavily based on [Heiswayi Nrird's](http://heiswayi.github.io) [the-plain](http://heiswayi.github.io/the-plain.html) theme, which in turn is based on [Leonard Lamprecht's](https://github.com/leo/leo.github.io) Jekyll theme and released under [MIT license](LICENSE). I also borrowed a few bits and pieces from clayh53's [tufte-jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) theme.

The logo incorporates "wayfarer" by [dackmin](http://vecteezy.com/members/dackmin)> from [vecteezy.com](http://www.vecteezy.com/) and "justice4" by [freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) from [flaticon.com](http://flaticon.com).
