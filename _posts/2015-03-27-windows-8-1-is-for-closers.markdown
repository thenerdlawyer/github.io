title: Windows 8.1 Is For Closers
feeling: frustration
---
Today I had the pleasure of chatting online with a Microsoft tech support agent, “Arnold R," about an issue I was having with Windows 7. Unfortunately, Arnold was more interested in upselling Windows 8.1 than he was in helping me resolve my problem. Worse, his technique involved repeatedly lying about easily confirmable facts.

Arnold answered my first question succinctly. But when I asked a follow-up, he launched into a hard upsell:

> **Arnold R:** …we highly recommend all Windows 7 users to the latest OS so they can get all updates and there will be no issues in the future.I can help you right now upgrade by sending a disc with a retail product key on it that you can use for installation and activation.

and

> Since we do have still a promotional hour today, I can still enroll you and offer it to you with a \$50 discount so it will just be for \$119.99 free shipping.

and

> I just don't want you to miss the boat on this promotion. let us go ahead and ship it now *since we still have one hour left here*.

Objection, non-responsive. Plus, a one-hour-only sale? For Windows 8.1? From *Microsoft*? Seems dubious. So I checked the website. Because I was online. On the Internet.

Maybe he meant the Pro edition?

> **Me:** the regular version or the pro?

> **Arnold R:** in local stores, the price for this is nearly \$200. The regular version. Because for the Windows 8.1 pro it is 199.99[^1]

[^1]: He later "confirmed" that \$199.99 was also a discounted price, and the Pro version is normally (i.e., any time but that hour) \$250.
OK, I call shenanigans. I sent him the [link] to the product page on the Microsoft website, as well as a [link to Amazon.com] where it was being offered for \$101.79.

> **Me:** I don't see anything that indicates this price is a promotion that ends in an hour.

> **Arnold R:** …That is because, it is not being displayed yet.

> **Me:** can you point me to where it says on the MSFT website that this is a limited-time promotional pricing?

> **Arnold R:** Upon checking here, that will not be displayed yet since there we received an information here in our end that there is an update going on our website that is the reason why we need to personally inform our customers that there is a limit of time on this promotion.

As my daughter is fond of saying, ***"What the what?!"***

> **Me:** I see. You were just informed about the limited-time pricing, but that information hasn't made it to the website yet?

> **Arnold R:** Correct. That is the reason why I informed you about this since I just don't want you to miss the boat on this promotion…it would really be best if you will take advantage of this today.

> So let us process this right now since this will just be quick. Can I have your phone number so I can call you.

No. No you cannot.

And then my phone rings.

At this point I’m getting bored. And annoyed. So I get him to finally answer my original question, which he does by telling me he can’t help me and I have to call a different department.

Not bloody likely.
